## Redirect Checker

This is a simple tool written in R for test and trace the redirects made by an URL.
It can be useful if you want to see the final URL for a shorten link (maybe is it suspicious?),
or to get rid of the trackers between your click in a website and the actual final URL.

### Features
- Shows the final destination of an URL.
- Display all the redirections and response codes for each one

### To come
- Option to remove tracking parameters from final URL
